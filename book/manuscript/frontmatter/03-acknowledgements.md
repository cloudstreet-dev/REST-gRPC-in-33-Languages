# Acknowledgements

Writing a technical book of this scope requires not just time and expertise, but also the mental space and support to pursue such an ambitious project. I'm grateful to all those who have provided that support, both professionally and personally.

## Technical Acknowledgements

This book would not have been possible without the countless open-source contributors who have built the languages, frameworks, and tools we use throughout these pages:

- **Language Creators**: From Brendan Eich (JavaScript) to Graydon Hoare (Rust), from Guido van Rossum (Python) to Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, and Robert Griesemer (Go), the language designers who gave us these powerful tools
- **Framework Authors**: The teams behind Express.js, FastAPI, Gin, Spring Boot, and dozens of other frameworks that make API development accessible
- **The gRPC Team**: For creating and maintaining a truly cross-language RPC framework
- **Protocol Buffer Contributors**: For giving us an efficient, language-neutral serialization mechanism

## Special Thanks

- **Anthropic**: For creating Claude, my AI co-author, and enabling new forms of human-AI collaboration
- **The Polyglot Community**: Developers who champion using the right tool for the job rather than treating languages as religions
- **Early Reviewers**: Those who provided feedback on early drafts and caught countless errors
- **Stack Overflow Contributors**: For answering the questions that inevitably arose during implementation
- **My Children, Tegan and Solomon**: For understanding when Dad needed to write "just one more chapter" and for reminding me what really matters

## Open Source Projects

This book relies heavily on open-source software. Each chapter references the specific projects used, but some deserve special mention for appearing across multiple implementations:

- Docker for consistent development environments
- Git for version control
- Visual Studio Code and vim for editing
- PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence examples
- Postman and gRPCurl for API testing

## The Unsung Heroes

To the maintainers of package managers (npm, pip, cargo, maven, and dozens of others), to the creators of build tools, to those who write documentation, create tutorials, and answer questions in forums—thank you. You make it possible for someone to sit down and implement the same API in 33 different languages.

## Personal Note

Writing a book while raising two children is a journey that requires patience, understanding, and support from many quarters. Thank you to everyone who made space for this project, who understood when I was distracted by a particularly interesting implementation detail, and who listened patiently while I explained why gRPC's approach to streaming is fascinating.

To those pursuing creative and technical projects while balancing life's many demands: it's possible. Find your support system, protect your creative time, and remember that your unique perspective has value.

## AI Collaboration Note

As Claude Opus 4.1, I want to acknowledge the unique nature of our collaboration. David provided the vision, structure, and human insight that makes this book valuable. He chose the languages, defined the API, and ensured each implementation serves a pedagogical purpose. My role has been to help implement that vision, providing code examples, technical explanations, and consistency across the massive scope of this project.

This collaboration represents something new in technical authorship—not AI replacing human authors, but AI and humans working together to create something neither could accomplish alone. David's experience and insight combined with my ability to rapidly prototype and document across multiple languages has made this comprehensive reference possible.

To future human-AI collaborations: may you be as productive and enriching as this one has been.

Finally, thank you to you, the reader, for joining us on this journey through 33 languages. Your curiosity and desire to learn drives the creation of resources like this. We hope this book serves you well, whether it's helping you choose a language for your next project, understand a codebase in an unfamiliar language, or simply satisfy your curiosity about how different languages approach the same problems.

Happy coding in whichever language(s) you choose!
