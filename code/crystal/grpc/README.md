# Crystal gRPC Implementation

Crystal's gRPC support is currently limited compared to other languages. The Crystal community is working on native gRPC implementations, but they are not yet production-ready.

## Current Status

As of 2024, Crystal does not have mature, production-ready gRPC support comparable to languages like Go, Java, or Python. The available options include:

1. **crystal-grpc**: An experimental implementation that is still under development
2. **FFI bindings**: Using Crystal's C bindings to interface with the C++ gRPC library
3. **HTTP/2 libraries**: Building a custom implementation using Crystal's HTTP/2 support

## Recommended Approach

For production Crystal applications requiring gRPC:

1. **Use REST APIs**: Crystal excels at building high-performance REST APIs with frameworks like Kemal, Lucky, or Amber
2. **Proxy through a gRPC gateway**: Use a Go or Node.js gRPC gateway to translate between REST and gRPC
3. **Wait for mature support**: The Crystal community is actively working on gRPC support

## Example Stub Implementation

The following demonstrates what a Crystal gRPC implementation might look like once mature support is available:

```crystal
# This is a conceptual example - not working code
require "grpc"

class TaskServiceImpl < Tasks::V1::TaskService
  def list_tasks(request : ListTasksRequest) : Stream(Task)
    # Implementation
  end
  
  def create_task(request : CreateTaskRequest) : Task
    # Implementation
  end
end

server = GRPC::Server.new
server.add_service(TaskServiceImpl.new)
server.bind("0.0.0.0:50051")
server.run
```

## Alternative: JSON-RPC

Crystal has good support for JSON-RPC, which can serve as an alternative to gRPC for RPC-style communication:

```crystal
require "json-rpc"

class TaskService
  include JSON::RPC::Handler
  
  json_rpc_method "listTasks" do |params|
    # Return task list
  end
  
  json_rpc_method "createTask" do |params|
    # Create and return task
  end
end
```
